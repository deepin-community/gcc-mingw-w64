gcc-mingw-w64 (24) unstable; urgency=medium

    This release of gcc-mingw-w64 changes the 32-bit exception handling
    mechanism from SJLJ to Dwarf2, to match MSYS2, Fedora, and other
    toolchains, and to allow the Rust toolchain to provide 32-bit
    cross-compilers.
    This will require rebuilding all artifacts built with previous
    releases of the toolchain. Shared binaries will need to be shipped
    with the dw2 DLL instead of the sjlj DLL.
